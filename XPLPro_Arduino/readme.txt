Known issues:
    
    Arduino Uno with I2c display seems to interfere with serial dialog between the arduino and Xplane.
    Incompatibility with some bluetooth serial port installations, try disabling them if you have issues.

    Remember to close your serial monitor if it is open, it will tie up the serial port and your device won't be found.
