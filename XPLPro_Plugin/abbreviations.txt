Put your dataref and command abbreviations here.  

Format: abbreviated=full_length

Abbreviated name is arbitrary and up to you, remember they are case sensitive and spaces are not allowed.
In my examples I group the lights with the prefix LT, annunciators with AN, etc.

LTbcn = sim/cockpit/electrical/beacon_lights_on
LTnav = sim/cockpit/electrical/nav_lights_on
LTland = sim/cockpit/electrical/landing_lights_on
LTstrobe = sim/cockpit/electrical/strobe_lights_on
LTtaxi = sim/cockpit/electrical/taxi_light_on
LTtax = sim/cockpit/electrical/taxi_light_on
LTlnd = sim/cockpit/electrical/landing_lights_on
LTnav = sim/cockpit/electrical/nav_lights_on
LTstr = sim/cockpit/electrical/strobe_lights_on

ANmc = sim/cockpit/warnings/annunciators/master_caution

Commands can be abbreviated as well:

CMDpause = sim/operation/pause_toggle
CMDtoga = sim/autopilot/take_off_go_around
CMDgearToggle = sim/flight_controls/landing_gear_toggle
